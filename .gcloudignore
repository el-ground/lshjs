# wildcards has issues :(
# Ignore everything

# Allow files and directories
!package.json
!yarn.lock

!dist/**

# ignore files within allowed files and directories
*.test.js
.gitignore
.git
*.swp
*DS_Store

# yarn w/o pnp
!.yarnrc.yml
# .pnp.* # ignored by default
!.yarn/**
# instead of adding required files, we'll exclude unnecessary files.
.yarn/cache
.yarn/install-state.gz
# !.yarn/patches/**
# !.yarn/plugins/**
# !.yarn/releases/**
# !.yarn/sdks/*
# !.yarn/versions/**

# Explicitly allow current dir. `gcloud deploy` fails without it.
